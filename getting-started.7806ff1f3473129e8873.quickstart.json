This example sets the partition to <code>1</code> for a single partition. Partitions are distinct lists of messages within a topic and enable parts of a topic to be distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster. A topic can contain one or more partitions, enabling producer and consumer loads to be scaled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Message retention</strong>: Set the message retention time and size to the relevant value and increment. This example sets the retention time to <code>7 days</code> and the retention size to <code>Unlimited</code>. Message retention time is the amount of time that messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted or compacted, depending on the cleanup policy. Retention size is the maximum total size of all log segments in a partition before they are deleted or compacted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Replicas</strong>: For this release of OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka, the replicas are preconfigured. The number of partition replicas for the topic is set to <code>3</code> and the minimum number of follower replicas that must be in sync with a partition leader is set to <code>2</code>. Replicas are copies of partitions in a topic. Partition replicas are distributed over multiple brokers in the cluster to ensure topic availability if a broker fails. When a follower replica is in sync with a partition leader, the follower replica can become the new partition leader if needed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After you complete the topic setup, the new Kafka topic is listed in the topics table.
